# TODO LIST (In no particular order)

* Convert TODO list to design document (what even is documentation?)
* User Session + Multi-User Support
* FileSystem (Storage API? - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage_API)
* Standard file system structure (user space vs system-wide)
* Permissions
* Process and Multi-Threading Support (WebWorkers)
* Pipes
* Networking (WebSockets)
* Windowing System (FAR in the future)
* Graphics API (WebGL)
* GPU General Processing (WebCL? Not super promising from a browser support standpoint. May end up implementing this via some WebGL hackery)
* Some sort of development environment + tools (OS isn't all that useful if you can only run basic commands)
* ASMJS for full/partial native program support? Will have to research this more thoroughly
* Package/Program Manager
